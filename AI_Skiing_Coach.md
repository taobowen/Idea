**Proposal: AI-Powered Skiing Coach Application**

**1. Introduction**
Skiing is a complex sport that requires precise body movements, balance, and control. Many amateur skiers struggle to improve their technique without professional guidance. Traditional ski coaching is expensive and not always accessible. To address this, we propose an **AI-powered skiing coach** that analyzes user-uploaded skiing videos, detects movement patterns, and provides personalized feedback to improve skiing techniques.

**2. Problem Statement**
- Skiers lack affordable and accessible feedback on their performance.
- Existing training solutions (coaches, ski schools) are costly and location-dependent.
- Self-training is inefficient due to the lack of structured feedback.

**3. Proposed Solution**
The AI skiing coach application will leverage **computer vision and machine learning** to analyze skiing techniques based on video uploads. Key features include:
- **Pose Estimation & Motion Tracking**: Identifies body posture, joint angles, and movement patterns.
- **Performance Analysis**: Compares movements with professional skiing techniques.
- **AI-Generated Feedback**: Provides real-time suggestions for improvement.
- **Progress Tracking**: Allows users to monitor their improvement over time.

**4. Technical Approach**
### **4.1 Data Collection**
- Use **existing motion capture datasets** (e.g., CMU Motion Capture, OpenPose datasets).
- Collect and label skiing videos featuring professional and amateur skiers.
- Extract keypoint data using **pose estimation models** like OpenPose, MediaPipe, or BlazePose.

### **4.2 AI Model Development**
- **Pose Classification**: Train a **CNN + LSTM** model to classify skiing postures (e.g., correct stance, leaning too far back, insufficient knee bend).
- **Rule-Based System** (for MVP): Develop initial feedback logic based on biomechanical rules.
- **Supervised Learning**: Train a model with labeled skiing techniques to automate feedback generation.

### **4.3 Feedback Generation**
- AI detects common errors and provides **personalized text-based and visual feedback**.
- Potential integration with **LLMs (GPT models)** to generate natural language coaching tips.
- Visual overlays showing **correct vs. incorrect posture**.

### **4.4 Deployment & User Interaction**
- **Mobile App/Web Platform** for users to upload videos.
- AI processes video and delivers feedback within seconds.
- Gamification features (progress tracking, skill levels, improvement reports).

**5. Expected Outcomes**
- **Improved Skiing Performance**: AI-driven insights help users correct mistakes faster.
- **Affordable & Accessible Coaching**: Eliminates the need for expensive personal training.
- **Scalability**: Can be expanded to other sports requiring motion analysis (e.g., snowboarding, skateboarding).

**6. Challenges & Mitigation Strategies**
| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Outdoor conditions affect video quality | Use AI-powered stabilization & noise reduction |
| Lack of labeled skiing data | Partner with ski schools, use semi-supervised learning |
| Real-time analysis latency | Optimize model inference with TensorRT or ONNX |

**7. Conclusion & Next Steps**
This AI skiing coach has the potential to revolutionize how skiers train, making professional guidance accessible to anyone with a smartphone. The next steps include:
1. **Building a prototype** using OpenPose for initial pose estimation.
2. **Collecting and labeling skiing data** to refine the model.
3. **Developing an MVP** with basic rule-based feedback and iterating based on user feedback.

With the right development approach, this application could become a game-changer in skiing coaching and sports training as a whole.
